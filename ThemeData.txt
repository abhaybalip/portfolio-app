Color Theme:

Text Color: Choose a light color that contrasts well with your dark background, such as white (#FFFFFF) or a light gray (#CCCCCC).

Background Color: Opt for a dark background to reduce eye strain, such as black (#000000) or a very dark gray (#121212).

Box and Border Colors: Use contrasting colors to differentiate sections and elements:

Boxes: Consider using shades of gray or a subtle dark color (#1A1A1A).
Borders: A slightly lighter or darker shade than the box color to create distinction without being too harsh.
